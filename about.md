title: About
---

I love living in Portland, OR with my partner and our kids. My business partner, [Sasha](https://www.chedygov.com/), and I run a [software consulting agency](https://www.semidecent.com/). Before making software I made [videos](/projects#videos) and I still enjoy filming when I can. My goal is to continue blending my professional background - the artistic with the technical: [stories](/fiction/subversion) + code.

Find me on [Mastodon](https://pdx.social/@suite22) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/suite22) if you'd rather speak in code. Always better to meet in-person and enjoy the beautiful area we live in, instead of the [small screens that tend to dominate our time](https://bengoertz.com/2021/06/07/match-mood/). I like to [write](/process) away from my computer whenever possible â€“ but here we are, reading on glowing screens.
