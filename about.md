title: About
---

I live in Portland, OR with my wife (who is [bravely running for City Council](https://www.lisaforportland.com)!) and kids (who are also brave ðŸ˜„). For [work](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bengoertz/), I write software (and try to make co-workers laugh in meetings). Previously, I worked as a [video editor and producer](/projects#videos). 

Creatively I'm learning to blend the artistic with the technical: [stories](/fiction/subversion) + code. [My post about the Drake equation](https://bengoertz.com/2021/11/22/drake-equation/) is an example with a small [Explorable Explanation](https://explorabl.es) section where you can try different values in the famous equation. 

I [try to write](/process) away from my computer whenever possible â€“ but here we are, reading on glowing screens.

Find me on [Mastodon](https://moth.social/@suite22) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/suite22) if you'd rather speak in code. Always better to meet in-person and enjoy the beautiful area we live in, instead of the [small screens that tend to dominate our time](https://bengoertz.com/2021/06/07/match-mood/).
