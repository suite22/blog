title: About
---

I love living in Portland, OR with my partner and our kids. Together with my business partner, [Sasha](https://www.chedygov.com/), I run a [software consultancy](https://www.semidecent.com/). Previously, I worked as a [video editor and producer](/projects#videos) and still enjoy filming when I can.

Creatively I'm trying to blend the artistic with the technical: [stories](/fiction/subversion) + code. A small is an [Explorable Explanation](https://explorabl.es) section in [my post about the Drake equation](https://bengoertz.com/2021/11/22/drake-equation/) where you can try different values in the famous equation.

I like to [write](/process) away from my computer whenever possible â€“ but here we are, reading on glowing screens.

Find me on [Mastodon](https://moth.social/@suite22) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/suite22) if you'd rather speak in code. Always better to meet in-person and enjoy the beautiful area we live in, instead of the [small screens that tend to dominate our time](https://bengoertz.com/2021/06/07/match-mood/).
