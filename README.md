# Personal Site powered by Jekyll 

[![Build and deploy Jekyll site to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/suite22/blog/actions/workflows/jekyll.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/suite22/blog/actions/workflows/jekyll.yml)

I forked the theme from dark-poole with the goal of hosting a "simple" site that I can publish to and write using markdown files and hopefully as little fuss as possible. 

To serve locally use:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Github Actions
On every change to the main branch the Github action should ðŸ¤ž run to deploy the latest version of the site to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Usage

### 0. Environment

* Install Homebrew
* Install `chruby`
* Install `ruby-install`
  * I've upgraded to use Ruby 3.3.0
* Use chruby for managing the local version of Ruby

### 1. Install dependencies

Poole is built on Jekyll and uses its built-in SCSS compiler to generate our CSS. Before getting started, you'll need to install the Jekyll gem and related dependencies:

```bash
$ gem install jekyll jekyll-gist jekyll-sitemap jekyll-seo-tag
```

### 2. Install bundler

You must have bundler installed. If you already have bundler installed, skip this step.

```bash
# Update Rubygems
$ gem update --system
# Update bundler
$ gem install bundler
```

Now install the bundle:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

### 3. Running locally

To see your Jekyll site with Poole applied, start a Jekyll server. In Terminal, from `/dark-poole` (or whatever your Jekyll site's root directory is named):

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Ah, but say you want to include [draft posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#drafts). Add this build flag:

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --draft
```

Drafts should be added to the `_drafts` folder without a date as a prefix in the filename. 

Open <http://localhost:4000> in your browser, and voilÃ .

### 4. Serving it up

You can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to host your project.

1. Fork this repo and switch to the `gh-pages` branch.
1. If you're [using a custom domain name](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages), modify the `CNAME` file to point to your new domain.
1. If you're not using a custom domain name, **modify the `url` in `_config.yml`** to point to your GitHub Pages URL. Example: for a site hosted at `username.github.io`, use `http://username.github.io`.
1. If you want to use your repo name as a base url, **set the `url`** to your repo link and **set the `baseurl`** to your repo name in **`_config.yml`**. Example: for site hosted on `https://username.github.io/dark-poole`, set `url` as `https://username.github.io/dark-poole` and `baseurl` as `/dark-poole`.
1. Done! Head to your GitHub Pages URL or custom domain.

No matter your production or hosting setup, be sure to verify the `baseurl` option file and `CNAME` settings. Not applying this correctly can mean broken styles on your site.

### 5. Pagination for sites with base urls

If you are using a base url for your site, (for example, hosted on `https://username.github.io/dark-poole`) you have to make some changes to get jekyll-pagination to work correctly:

In `_config.yml`, add this line:

```yaml
paginate_path: "/baseurl/page:num/"
```

In `archive.md`, add `{{ site.baseurl }}` before `{{ post.url }}`

```html
<!-- Add "{{ site.baseurl }}" -->
<li><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
```

In `index.html`, remove the `prepend:`:

```html
<!-- Remove "prepend:" in "prepend: relative_url" -->
<a
  class="pagination-item newer"
  href="{{ paginator.previous_page_path | relative_url }}"
  >Newer</a
>
```

## Development

CSS is handled via Jeykll's built-in Sass compiler. Source Sass files are located in `_sass/`, included into `styles.scss`, and compile to `styles.css`.

### Customize Navbar

You can easily customize the navbar by tweaking the `_config.yml` file. Simply change the title and url of each of the nav elements, or add more. The order will be preserved in the site.

```yaml
nav:
  - title: Blog
    url: /posts

  - title: About
    url: /about
```

## Quotebacks

I love the intent behind [Quoteback](https://quotebacks.net) and my goal is to use them whenever I cite someone else. 

## Interactive articles

I'd like to try writing some interactive [explorable explanations](https://explorabl.es). The main tools I've looked at are [Curvenote](https://curvenote.dev) and [idyll](https://github.com/idyll-lang). I used [idyll-embed](https://github.com/idyll-lang/idyll-embed) to create the first explorable on the site - [Exploring the Drake Equation](https://bengoertz.com/2021/11/22/drake-equation/).

## Oops!

Something broke again. Did I / you / me remember to:

### Ruby version
Did you set the [version of ruby](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54873916/5499522) using `chruby`?

```bash
chruby 2.7.2
```

### M1 Processor
Did you try to install Ruby on a Mac with Apple silicon and read through several blog posts? Read this and update `ffi` https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-homebrew-and-ruby-on-a-mac-with-the-m1-apple-silicon-chip/

## Image Assets
(This might be a poor choice for the future...) The maximum width of the stylesheet right now is 672 pixels so I've been resizing images down for faster loading and to limit the bloat in the repo.
