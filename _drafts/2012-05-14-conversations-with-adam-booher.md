Freelancing leads to more cross-polination. I wish more of the worlds workforce was fluid, so that more ideas could mingle and create new connections. Creativity is connecting different ideas ~ Steve Jobs

The American Health Insurance system is broken. It shouldn’t be tied to our employers. People should pay for themselves. Insurance companies could pool risk in many different ways to make it work for people who are higher risk.

Charge what it’s worth, not what it costs. I’ve been telling my students about the importance of understaning their basic living costs - you probably need at least 25K to live the basic life you want. Now that you know your cost structure, reverse back to an hourly rate that makes sense - $15/hr? $25/hr? Probably only have 20 billable hours a week - half your time working won’t be billable.

Why do we as video makers stop at the point of boxing up our finished story and then putting them on the shelf? Why doesn’t the storytelling continue into how we share and view the story? Maybe a non-linear story should be told non-linearly instead of by the editor. Why aren’t we building more choose your own adventure videos instead of these fixed viewpoints that parade around as the truth. It’s only the truth as you’ve deemed worthly of your film. The facts have been arranged and influenced by so many factors. Let people see the creative process.

Why are we afraid to reveal the creative process? Booher said because our first drafts are so embarassesing. Or maybe because we don’t want to give away the secret sauce. What’s so secret about writing a fact based news story? I want to be able to see back to the source - the transcript, the recording - whatever it is that lets me know this is based upon something real. The reward of showing your reader that this can be trusted should be worth any trade off in the revelation of the process.

Why can’t we see more of the interview to reveal the full context? Was the interviewer asking a gotcha question? More specifically were they feeding them a line? Why did the questioners voice sound so strange in Inside Job?

I want to be able to watch a movie and know that the people talking isn’t being manipulated by the editor. Show me more of the context of that quick sound bite you pulled out. Was it real? Allow the viewer to roll our the in-out points if they want to.

Genetic critisism should be more intuative and built into the publication process.
