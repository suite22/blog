It's interesting the people who realize they only have a short time to live. We find their stories inspiring. 50/50 for example. Why do we assume the same is not true of us? Just because I might live to 85 doesn't mean I only have a short time. 

With this in mind it changes my interest in many things. I've started reading more books because at the rate I'm going I'll only read 60 more. They better be good. 

I'm not trying to be uptight and plan everything. Many things just have to happen. What I am saying is the things we learn and choose to focus on should be worthwhile. Valuable and meaningful to us and the people around us.
