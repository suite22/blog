Dear Netflix, Theaters Are Not Your Enemy
In their recent letter to shareholder's, Netflix seemed to soften their stance ever so slightly on distributing their films to theaters:
> Since our members are funding these films, they should be the first to see them. But we are also open to supporting the large theater chains, such as AMC and Regal in the US, if they want to offer our films, such as our upcoming Will Smith film  Bright, in theatres simultaneous to Netflix. Let consumers choose.
~ Netflix Shareholder letter 2017 Q1

Netflix is a data driven company, and I think they really should let the consumer choose. Put the films in theaters and watch the numbers. See what people do. If it negatively impacts subscriber numbers without a gain from theater revenues to offset, end the experiment. But it might be great for Netflix to put the films in theater first. Here's why:

The underlying logic of "members are funding these films and should see them first" is interesting but it doesn't mean members have to see it immediately on Netflix. Members could see the premiere in theaters, perhaps with discounted or "free" tickets as part of their membership, and then later on Netflix after the traditional exclusive theater window. Why would Netflix dare cave to the day-in-date demands of the greedy theaters? Because theaters are not the enemy.
Free Movie Tickets?
Netflix is fighting the wrong war by playing coy with theaters over day-in-date. Theaters are not willing to budge on day-in-date right now (although you can imagine a future where they might) and Amazon is willing to play ball with theaters.  Amazon Video is the greatest threat to Netflix long term, not theaters.
Subscriber growth has slowed domestically for Netflix as the market matures and the fight for the remaining non-subscribers becomes harder. Where could Netflix find more movie lovers who they could convince to join (or re-join) the service? Movie theaters! 
They could keep their brand promise to members by "giving away" tickets to see War Machine in theaters. The gain is all the potential non-members who are willing to pay to go see the movie and then have a greater chance of paying for a Netflix subscription in future when they want to see War Machine again. Remember Netflix exclusive films aren't available on blu-ray or DVD. If someone wants to see Beast of No Nation or XYZ they have to pay for Netflix.

Movie theaters are not a direct threat because they serve different purposes. Amazon is the greatest threat to Netflix because they serve exactly the same he's case they're both intended for streaming anywhere where is theaters have a long served a more social purpose. theaters have a long serve a more social purpose which sometimes is in conflict in competition with streaming but in many ways and complementary you still have people talk about going on a movie dinner and a movie date night as a couple which targets a different demographic then the Netflix and chill crowd.
Radio Station Promotion
Building a back catalog of valuable content is a longterm play. Right now Netflix is creating top tier content that may never be seen by the key people they want to join - non-members. Just like radio stations have promoted music for decades, movie theaters can be the venue that promotes films and increases the longterm value by having more people see it and form a connection with it.
the customers if they want to reach the US as it is a developed saturated market at this stage and so they're not just going after a Greenfield of people you haven't heard of Netflix almost everyone has heard of Netflix that is a potential customer they just might not have a reason to join and content
 alone may not be the thing that causes someone to join there may be a there may need to be an extra push of some sort of connection to that content and having a film that you've seen in theaters does form a stronger connection to it and then something that you've only just seen the preview for or TV commercial there's only so much promotion the Netflix can do for these content pieces that they're making us that don't involve people signing a taxi see the thing there's not a way to really trial it other than that other than the free monthly trial on they need a way to get people in the door this is why Spotify has the free tear this is why music has forever been available on the radio as a promotion tool they're making the difference between some of the original content is been made in the past like HBO making films is those phones were always targeted at a smaller subset of people who it wasn't necessarily a theatrical film anyway of the film made specifically by and for HBO which play a different role it was a small and a small market comedy or something and now with some of these big film Zieser top 40 hit 
You Can't Sing Along If You Don't Know The Words
Netflix is trying to make top 40 hits that people can to sing along to and yet they are going on and playing the festival circuit really and they're not going and playing in theaters so people are not going to be holding up their lighter than 10 years for these movies because many people have never seen them and want and it will only be Netflix subscriber seeing them and word-of-mouth can only carry so far on these dumb because the people if you are a person somewhere in America who doesn't have Netflix and doesn't know someone as Netflix how are you going to hear about these felt the way you could hear about them is by seeing them in theater scene and

The big benefit here is if they did put it in theaters is what trailers are going to show before these films it's going to be all Netflix original content displayed before these trailer so when you go see war machine with Brad Pitt you'll see another ad for house of cards and you'll see another ad for sensei and you'll see another ad for all the different film them coming will smith bright they could go down a very long list and fill up by every trailer before the film would be just for Netflix content and many of those things would only be available as a subscriber and would never make it to the theater the theater is purely a promotional tool to get people connect

The theater is purely a promotion until they get people connected to the content you're just trying to get people to see it for the first time and then from there whenever they think about it whenever I think about I want to see that again I'm going to have to sign up for Netflix so you're sacrificing that upfront first viewing but gaining the potential rewatch gaining a potential like affinity for that content in your building up more connections to the brand more connections to the thing that will forever be exclusive to Netflix it's not like they're in investing cortical investing by letting people see the film and theater and then by letting people see it first for free potential he in theater you're investing in the long-term value of that content you're saying that over the life of this content it will only be available first 90 days at most in theaters and every day after that it will be exclusive to Netflix it will be an exclusive original that if you ever want to see again for any reason it's only available on Netflix and only available as a subscriber and that will get more valuable overtime as more people form connection with Brad Pitt movie and Will Smith movie and all of these pieces of content that wolf
more and more of these pieces of content I will forever be locked into Netflix this is a short window to get people in the door and so by giving members free access quoting quote to the theater you're building up positive promotion and brand affinity for Netflix itself and for the content which makes it more valuable for those members directly but also for new people who are not members there now seeing it and they now have a reason to think about signing up for Netflix it's more valuable then running TV spots again things that people are flooded with this as a chance to get the connection directly with the thing this is a chance to connect people directly with the thing that you're doing you're connecting people directly with the content with high-quality top-tier work that will only be available on Netflix in for this limited moment it's in the theaters and you can imagine that in the future this arrangement of day and date negotiations will change.
This is Not a Charity Deal
The shocking part of this is that Netflix is so tied to their strategy on this that it's not like they're having to give these film the way to theaters this is a his stork business arrangement has worked for every other studio very very successfully where they make money on theater ticket sales for all these new people that would be going to see war machines were not Netflix subscribers they would be paying money to go see it that money would go to Netflix they would make more on that then they would over the course of one or two months of people signing up for canceling just to see that film it's it it's not is this is purely purely a charity arrangement Netflix would still make some money on this and the amount of promotional cost would far outweigh the other alternative forms of promotion that they have to do at this stage they are trying to get laid adopters and they're trying to get people who are hesitant to sign up and have another subscription or I haven't signed up for Netflix for some reason or have left a need to return they need a reason to return the Netflix is not going to get these people by just you know running more radio ads or running more television spots they are going to need to give people bigger and bigger reasons to join and having big budget top-tier content that they've seen in theater and now have some connection to they love that movie but they can't necessarily go by the Blu-ray and instead of buying the Blu-ray they go and they pay for Netflix and they join and then that lifetime membership value is significantly offset by the cost of promoting films in theater like this they're not necessarily driving people away from Netflix in that brief moment someone will spend two hours in a theater that they won't be spending on Netflix but for the lifetime of but just because you're not watching Netflix at that moment does not mean it is hurting Netflix this is a small strategic cost for the long-term gain of having more and more people who are not yet subscribers and it even for people who are subscribers to have connections to content that they will need Netflix to get later on when they want to see it.

Theater and "Home Video" Have Worked Together for Years

The biggest risk of the strategy is confusion consumer confusion the technical details of working out with theaters but all of these arrangements taking place now with filmmakers with festivals with theaters all negotiated a a you know piecemeal I not avant-garde but there needs to be the old one off arrangements that are negotiated by an entire staff of content people at Netflix that same group of people marketing people and content people could work out how this would would play out and there's a lot of different ways to shuffle the accounting on this it doesn't just have to be on it doesn't just have to be this a specific arrangement with theater there's a lot of different ways that Netflix could experiment with this through the accounting make a note discount the theatrical fee to the to the to the to the theater I and how much they charge per person or how much it cost to put it on the screen they could maybe eat or just eat the cost of free members are coming in in theaters would be willing to do it because they get the I am they get the Coke and candy sales you know there's a lot of different ways that this could be mutually beneficial for Netflix would only be spending a very small amount of money to promote this and we're basically talking about investing in the content as a promotional strategy this is purely just a promotional play but it's the sort of thing that would earn Goodwill with filmmakers Goodwill with members Goodwill with theaters and they could parlay that goodwill into future benefits.

Use the Production Slate
The big other piece to think about here for Netflix is they control more than just one film this isn't them just trying to get one machine in the theater then entire production flight that is almost as big as the studio and went to the studio what did the studios do with their production place they put constraints around the production slate of how they're showing in theaters and what configuration I did because they hold the keys to the content theaters need. Netflix is in a great negotiating position for this they can stay if you want to take War Machine you also need to take this other indie film that may not get much traction on Netflix directly this again just to play to spread the brand to spread affinity for signing up for staying subscribe and for some of these they may not give away free tickets it may just be a chance to get
Filmmakers Love the Big Screen
I'm ready for my closeup
One of the biggest concerns here for Netflix is the cost of getting content the cost of buying content for the service and some filmmakers have already shown that they don't want to sell the Netflix if it's not gonna show up in theaters so they're paying a premium for content are paying above and beyond the normal cost because they have to convince filmmakers that it's worth not getting a theatrical run to be on Netflix so they're paying more than they really probably could if they also allowed filmmakers to appear in theaters this is what people spend their entire careers their childhood they want to be on the big screen they want their friends and family to see it and maybe it's just in our house right it doesn't have to be a nationwide distribution but even in our house run for beast of no nation if they're willing to give on the day and day that's the only thing they really have to get them but if they're willing to give one day and date then they have a chance to really went over some filmmakers who Who are hesitant to join and sell to the service because they don't want to miss out on that social cachet that social a benefit that they gain from telling all their friends that they are on the big screen and same with the actors and same with everyone involved people want to be on the big screen this is still a star business people are still movie stars and it's harder and harder to be a star if you're only available on a limited service you still need to get out on the red carpet and have that premier and have that feeling of being grand and grandiose that's still really valuable to the people involved in the industry it's not just A moneymaking enterprise.

The greatest threat that Netflix faces is Amazon not theaters. could act as their radio station airplay it could act as a promotion channel they could act as partners in pushing content that is only available on Netflix and actually be up without being owned by Netflix could be an arm of their marketing department through very minor monetary and strategy concessions.
