Visualizing semantic webs

We can change the viewpoint or center of the map.

Make new connections based on the semantic connections.

Above that we can start to make smart queries of the relationships.

- So me all countries that went through a one year period of inflation above 10%. What happened? What were the long term effects?

These are the sorts of questions average readers of the NY Times or WSJ should be able to discover on their own after reading an article about the historic implications of the economic crisis in the US. Maybe people will make inaccurate connections between data points that are not related, but how is that worse than what goes on now? Billions of uneducated people making connections off superstition and unquestioned biases.

This is a tool meant for the curious. If you think the news is fair and meaningful now, this isn't meant for you. I want to know more about each and every article I read. If the topic is interesting why shouldn't I see related information by more than just keywords. I want to know where the reporter is pulling their information from? Why make everyone else go back and repeat the leg work that reporter has done? Make the knowledge public and then let the rest of the world build upon it. We don't need more data collectors as much as we need people who can assimilate and sort the vast quantities of data we already have.
