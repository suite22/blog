I'm talking about a visual way to interact with and explore subject matter. At the highest levels you only see the majors areas of thought. As you want to learn more you zoom in down to another level - 30,000ft - to see the sub-divisions within that field. Eventually you're down at the lower levels where the details and on going research are happening. None of this would be locked into a rigid hierarchy because semantic links would allow for different ways of sorts and filtering the relationships.

Only see the details when you want to.

Like a rich interactive Prezi or Vue.

So if I'm interested in learning about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda">Uganda</a> I can find all the basic facts included in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda">Wikipedia article</a>: capital, form of government, official language, etc... The next step in learning is to try to relate it to what we already know and then start to ask questions. How is Uganda different from neighboring countries? How is it similar? In asking these questions we need comparable information or data to help us. On the Wikipedia article we can find several

However, I have no context for many of the key indicators like GDP or even their date of independence. How has their economy changed over the past 20 years? When did other African countries gain their independence? These questions are best explored in a visual way, compared to the mountain of text that dominates Wikipedia and most text books.

Even the map included on Wikipedia is not labeled or interactive in any way!

When learning about economics recently for example

I wish to see the leading thinkers represented on a timeline, maybe with the dates of their most famous works. Maybe instead it’s just a timeline of Noble Prize winners and their key contribution to the field. From their a basic layout of the main schools of thought would better prepare me for understanding where I am within the context of the broad field.

For example, which Universities have the closest ties based on academic papers that are co-published with other faculty?
