After a bit of reading online I think I'm finally on the trail of what I've been searching for - how to link different ideas together across different hierarchies. Here is the situation now - I am studying economics and as I learn about key economist I want to understand where they are in the context of different schools of thought. For example, <a class="zem_slink" title="Milton Friedman" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman" rel="wikipedia">Milton Friedman</a> is listed as "<a class="zem_slink" title="Chicago school of economics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_school_of_economics" rel="wikipedia">Chicago School of Economics</a>" by Wikipedia, <a class="zem_slink" title="Ludwig von Mises" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises" rel="wikipedia">Ludwig von Mises</a> as "<a class="zem_slink" title="Austrian School" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School" rel="wikipedia">Austrian</a>", and <a class="zem_slink" title="Paul Krugman" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krugman" rel="wikipedia">Paul Krugman</a> as "<a class="zem_slink" title="Keynesian economics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics" rel="wikipedia">Keynesian</a>." The typical presentation is a simple hierarchy, maybe in a mind map format.

It's simple to understand the levels of the hierarchy but what I want to know is what are the cross-connections between different people. For example, which people tend to co-author articles with people from other schools of thought? Which individuals bridge the space in-between different schools of thought? Which universities are graduating people into these schools of thought? For example the <a title="University of Chicago" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago" rel="wikipedia">University of Chicago</a> seems to have fewer Neo-Keynesians.

As a seasoned researcher you come to expect a particular bias merely through your experience, but as someone new to the field I have a hard time placing what some of the influencing factors on the research might be. If however there was a way that I could see quickly which schools some of these main thinkers came from or worked at, I could orient myself in a broad sense quickly. When I start to ask these questions I begin to wonder if these hierarchies of thought we create are all that meaningful.

We all have an urge to categorize and sub-divide but the problem with traditional hierarchies is we are limited to a single dimension or way of sorting. The future is in "<a title="Semantic Web" href="http://semanticweb.org/">semantic</a>" links that allow items to be linked together with meta-data describing the type of link. I will be posting more soon about some of the partial solutions I've found. So far nothing seems to answer the underlying problem.
