title: "Building your A, B, C, D list"
---

I have students ask me a lot of questions about how to get started looking for their first jobs.
One thing I recommend is to know at least where you want to aim. Many students have no idea where to apply because they've never done any research. Find out who does the best work or the work you want to do when you grow up. Put those companies on your dream list - A group.

My A group:
Parliament
Minority Report guy

Now you know where your goal is. Do some googling to find out who else is in the same field. This is a great time to find even more great A list companies that might be flying under the radar or open right around the corner. Put companies in the same field or in closer proximity to where you want to live in group B. They're good, but not perfect. Many times these companies are regional or closer to home.

Group C list out companies right around you who are just anywhere close to what you're looking for. If you want to do web design, most likely your local web company will go here - unless of course your dream job is right around the corner.

Group D is anybody that will give you a job. Starbucks, McDonalds. Anybody! I don't care how much education on you have, you need a job! Always!

The main reason is group F is only for people who fail to get something from all the other lists.
By the time you've done with much research and learned about companies you love, you should have no problem finding something to help you get started towards a dream company on your A list.
