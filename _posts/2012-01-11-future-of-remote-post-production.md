I want to briefly cover how I completed color grading a national TV spot from my basement in Tuscaloosa, AL.

One would think a hick like me wouldn't stand a chance against the titans of NY, LA, ATL, NO, Nashville, etc... But if the director works in Jacksonville, why does he care where it ends up? He just wants what everyone should want - the best final product possible.

What I found exciting about this project was the speed with which everything had to be turned around.

Everything had to be turned around in a very quick time frame per usual.

# THE TIMELINE

I think Greg called sometime late in the afternoon to ask if I would be interested in working on the spot. We talked for a bit and got to know each other. At that time I think we made a informal agreement to get started and review the more complex shots in the spot. After watching his roughcut I knew the final shot was going to be most difficult to grade, because of the long take and wide difference from start to end.

Later that evening we agreed to start working and he started uploading everything to Dropbox right away. I think I had a few shots downloaded that evening before I went to bed, but everything else continued to download overnight.

# THE PROCESS

We used a shared Dropbox folder to send everything I needed for the spot.

Obviously, I don't have all the equipment the big dogs have, but with Apple Color and DaVinci Resolve Lite I have two great software options for under $1K. Sadly it looks like Apple has silently killed Color, but DaVinci is upsetting the market by offering Resolve for only $1K now! So my simple setup here in Alabama now has the same software that people used to pay six-digits for.

Mind you I don't have the fastest internet connection, but it was enough to get this job done.

# BIG PICTURE

So what does this mean for the big shops? There's still a place for whoo'ing the big shots with coffee and a nice sofa while they watch the correction take place. For a lot of projects though the budgets continue to shrink and

Everyone knows the internet is changing the way we work. As a younger worker I see a lot of positives that can come.

It's all about the final product. What shows up on the screen. If you're spending money on something that doesn't effect the final product then why are you spending that money? Old habits die hard, but at some point things shift and people re-adjust. I think that time is here now.

If I can learn to color correct something in a place with low overhead, then that means I can pass the savings on to my client. Along the way we're both making more money. That competitive squeeze is going to force all of us to get better.

If I'm in Alabama taking a freelance job from someone in LA or New York, why can't someone in India learn to take it from me? That line of thinking only makes me want to be better. I still want to work at a nice post house in the future. I still see that as a long-term goal.

Remote work is the future.

One day I hope to end up working with a great team at a post-house somewhere, but until then I can charge a lower rate to pick up work from anywhere.
