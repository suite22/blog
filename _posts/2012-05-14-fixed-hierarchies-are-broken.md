# FIXED HIERARCHIES ARE BROKEN

Most of our current learning is done through fixed hierarchies that have been strictly enforced to the point of overshadowing the real information. One of the best examples of structure being forced onto the data is art. Music has no inherent genre when it's written. That's merely a label we tack and fight over later to try and group similar artists. Pandora and other technologies have almost eliminated any practical reason to rely on searching for interesting music based on genre, yet we still see common phrases like “indie” or “rock.” These genre terms might carry enough meaning to tell the difference between rap or country, but once we start grouping artists within “indie,” what do they really share in common? From the perspective of the listener, do I really care about the category that’s tacked onto the music or am I just interested in listening to artists that sound like artists I like?

# DYNAMIC GROUPING

Data visualizations having been using this trick for a while, but think about the power of removing the walls we’ve built around our information and allowing the connections we value to group items together. The great power of this of course is that my personal preferences can be taken into account as the computer works to cluster items based on the connections I use to filter the data.

Companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Pandora are already doing this with their recommendation engines, but visual nature of these connections is hidden from the viewer. The benefit of unmasking the process is that not all connections are equal - Superfreakanomics is much closer to Freakanomics than Dubner’s other books even though all the books share the same author. By visually representing these connections we can learn more about what other people like you are reading or maybe compare your preferences to the rest of the world. USE AMAZON SHOPPING VIZ EXAMPLE

I want a relational way to build up and store information that I can later play with and visualize to understand better.

So I'm building a web, but on top of that the connections need to have information about what type of relationship it is.

I then need to be able to sort and filter / rotate the date into different dimensions to see new and unique connections.

Not all relationships are created equal. Stronger connections will have stronger bonds to quickly show like items.

Ultimately by using dynamic group we can start to move away from the problem of fixed rigid organizations.

Why are we incessantly building all these structures of thought into fixed hierarchies?

We want to understand the world, so we break it down into categories: history, science, math, philosophy, etc...

We open the newspaper and read different sections depending on our interests: world news, local news, sports, weather, entertainment, etc...

Without getting into philosophy, most people agree these basic categories make sense.

That works fine when we assume everything is already known.

But what about when we move further down the line and something doesn't seem to fit into the right category? Is U2's music rock or pop or both? Do the Avett Brothers play folk, Americana, or indie rock? At what point do our categories become too broad to have any meaning?

These overused and now empty terms, are not integral to the art or object itself; they are imposed from the outside the art.

So is there a better way? Can we still sub-divide and group things to help us understand without resorting to rigid structures?

We need an organic, living, semantic web that naturally form clusters of like items. This information already exists through the suggestion engines we use everyday on iTunes, Netflix, Last.fm... What I'm talking about though is a more intuitive navigation system that allows users to follow their own trails in real time. Touch interfaces like the iPad create the perfect context for future interactions like this.
