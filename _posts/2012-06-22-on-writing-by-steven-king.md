# My Highlights & Notes

In many ways, Eula-Beulah prepared me for literary criticism. After having a two-hundred-pound babysitter fart on your face and yell Pow!, The Village Voice holds few terrors.<a href="kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=119">Read more at location 119

<div>If she had suggested that the time I spent writing stories on the front porch of our rented house on Pond Street or in the laundry room of our rented trailer on Klatt Road in Hermon was wasted time, I think a lot of the heart would have gone out of me. Tabby never voiced a single doubt, however. Her support was a constant, one of the few good things I could take as a given. And whenever I see a first novel dedicated to a wife (or a husband), I smile and think, There’s someone who knows.<a href="kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=821">Read more at location 821</a></div>

<div>The most important is that the writer’s original perception of a character or characters may be as erroneous as the reader’s. Running a close second was the realization that stopping a piece of work just because it’s hard, either emotionally or imaginatively, is a bad idea. Sometimes you have to go on when you don’t feel like it, and sometimes you’re doing good work when it feels like all you’re managing is to shovel shit from a sitting position.<a href="kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=875">Read more at location 875</a></div>

<div>the Hemingway Defense goes something like this: as a writer, I am a very sensitive fellow, but I am also a man, and real men don’t give in to their sensitivities. Only sissy- men do that. Therefore I drink. How else can I face the existential horror of it all and continue to work? Besides, come on, I can handle it.

The idea that creative endeavor and mind-altering substances are entwined is one of the great pop-intellectual myths of our time.<a href="kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1160">Read more at location 1160</a>

<div></div>
<div>Hemingway and Fitzgerald didn’t drink because they were creative, alienated, or morally weak. They drank because it’s what alkies are wired up to do. Creative people probably do run a greater risk of alcoholism and addiction than those in some other jobs, but so what? We all look pretty much the same when we’re puking in the gutter.<a href="kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1168">Read more at location 1168</a></div>

<div></div>
<div>I want to suggest that to write to your best abilities, it behooves you to construct your own toolbox and then build up enough muscle so you can carry it with you. Then, instead of looking at a hard job and getting discouraged, you will perhaps seize the correct tool and get immediately to work.<a href="kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1295">Read more at location 1295</a></div>

<div></div>
<div>I’m not trying to get you to talk dirty, only plain and direct. Remember that the basic rule of vocabulary is use the first word that comes to your mind, if it is appropriate and colorful. If you hesitate and cogitate, you will come up with another word—of course you will, there’s always another word—but it probably won’t be as good as your first one, or as close to what you really mean.<a href="kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1345">Read more at location 1345</a></div>
<div></div>
<div>This business of meaning is a very big deal. If you doubt it, think of all the times you’ve heard someone say “I just can’t describe it” or “That isn’t what I mean.” Think of all the times you’ve said those things yourself, usually in a tone of mild or serious frustration. The word is only a representation of the meaning; even at its best, writing almost always falls short of full meaning. Given that, why in God’s name would you want to make things worse by choosing a word which is only cousin to the one you really wanted to use?<a href="kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1348">Read more at location 1348</a></div>

<div>Verbs come in two types, active and passive. With an active verb, the subject of the sentence is doing something. With a passive verb, something is being done to the subject of the sentence. The subject is just letting it happen. You should avoid the passive tense.<a href="kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1411">Read more at location 1411</a>

<div>I think timid writers like them for the same reason timid lovers like passive partners. The passive voice is safe. There is no troublesome action to contend with; the subject just has to close its eyes and think of England, to paraphrase Queen Victoria.

<div>I’m convinced that fear is at the root of most bad writing. If one is writing for one’s own pleasure, that fear may be mild—timidity is the word I’ve used here. If, however, one is working under deadline—a school paper, a newspaper article, the SAT writing sample—that fear may be intense.<a href="kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1484">Read more at location 1484</a>

</div>
<div>Good writing is often about letting go of fear and affectation. Affectation itself, beginning with the need to define some sorts of writing as “good” and other sorts as “bad,” is fearful behavior. Good writing is also about making good choices when it comes to picking the tools you plan to work with.<a href="kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1491">Read more at location 1491</a>

The object of fiction isn’t grammatical correctness but to make the reader welcome and then tell a story … to make him/her forget, whenever possible, that he/she is reading a story at all. The single-sentence paragraph more closely resembles talk than writing, and that’s good. Writing is seduction. Good talk is part of seduction.<a href="kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1571">Read more at location 1571</a>

The first is that good writing consists of mastering the fundamentals (vocabulary, grammar, the elements of style) and then filling the third level of your toolbox with the right instruments. The second is that while it is impossible to make a competent writer out of a bad writer, and while it is equally impossible to make a great writer out of a good one, it is possible, with lots of hard work, dedication, and timely help, to make a good writer out of a merely competent one.<a href="kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1631">Read more at location 1631</a>

<div>You may wonder where plot is in all this. The answer—my answer, anyway—is nowhere. I won’t try to convince you that I’ve never plotted any more than I’d try to convince you that I’ve never told a lie, but I do both as infrequently as possible. I distrust plot for two reasons: first, because our lives are largely plotless, even when you add in all our reasonable precautions and careful planning; and second, because I believe plotting and the spontaneity of real creation aren’t compatible. It’s best that I be as clear about this as I can—I want you to understand that my basic belief about the making of stories is that they pretty much make themselves. The job of the writer is to give them a place to grow (and to transcribe them, of course). If you can see things this way (or at least try to), we can work together comfortably. If, on the other hand, you decide I’m crazy, that’s fine. You won’t be the first.<a href="kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=1912">Read more at location 1912</a>

<div>For me, what happens to characters as a story progresses depends solely on what I discover about them as I go along— how they grow, in other words. Sometimes they grow a little. If they grow a lot, they begin to influence the course of the story instead of the other way around.<a href="kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2292">Read more at location 2292</a>

<div>I think the best stories always end up being about the people rather than the event, which is to say character-driven. Once you get beyond the short story, though (two to four thousand words, let’s say), I’m not much of a believer in the so-called character study; I think that in the end, the story should always be the boss. Hey, if you want a character study, buy a biography or get season tickets to your local college’s theater-lab productions. You’ll get all the character you can stand.<a href="kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2296">Read more at location 2296</a>

<div>It’s also important to remember that no one is “the bad guy” or “the best friend” or “the whore with a heart of gold” in real life; in real life we each of us regard ourselves as the main character, the protagonist, the big cheese; the camera is on us, baby. If you can bring this attitude into your fiction, you may not find it easier to create brilliant characters, but it will be harder for you to create the sort of one-dimensional dopes that populate so much pop fiction.<a href="kindle://book?action=open&asin=B000FC0SIM&location=2300">Read more at location 2300</a>

<div>The most important things to remember about back story are that (a) everyone has a history and (b) most of it isn’t very interesting.
