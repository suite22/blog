I've been stretching myself to try new creative projects that in one way or another intimidate me. When possible, I've tried to step away from computers and make real things with my hands â€“ which is actually difficult to pull off!

## Hand Lettering & Sign Painting + RISO Printing
This past weekend I took a hand lettering class at [Outlet](https://www.outletpdx.com) (imagine all the brightest and beautiful art perfectly arranged in your cool neighbors converted garage) and made this [RISO](https://www.stencil.wiki/) print for my [partner's campaign](https://www.lisaforportland.com):

I have a whole new level of respect for hand lettered signs around town!

Whenever I complete a RISO print project I learn something new! The challenge and the imperfections (and in many cases the printing deadline) are all part of the joy of it.

## Campaign Zine
There's one more page to complete for the 12 page zine I've been working on to celebrate the kickoff event for the campaign. Here's a small preview of one of the handmade RISO spreads:

## Letterpress 
Back in February I took a letterpress class at the [IPRC](https://www.iprc.org/) (a magical wonderland).

<div class="extended-content-container">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th><img src="/assets/real-things/letterpressSetup.jpeg"/></th>
      <th><img src="/assets/real-things/letterpressStudio.jpeg"/></th>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

As always, completing a project like that gave me a new level of appreciation for letterpress work. It took many hours to learn to setup only a few lines of text and ultimately print a few dozen bookmarks.

## RISO Printed Short Stories
My brother and I have a pair of [short](https://exodus-stories.space/chapters/subversion.html) [stories](https://exodus-stories.space/chapters/TheGuideAndTheSleeper.html) we RISO printed at the IPRC last fall but I got sidetracked from completing the covers on them. I need to design the covers and get these out into the world:

<div class="extended-content-container">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th><img src="/assets/real-things/exodusStories-guide-RISO.jpeg"/></th>
      <th><img src="/assets/real-things/exodusStories-papers-RISO.jpeg"/></th>
      <th><img src="/assets/real-things/exodusStories-poem-RISO.jpeg"/></th>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

I keep pushing myself to create more meaningful work. Gathering these projects up and seeing the progress is a good reminder to breathe and enjoy the cool things that have already made it into the world.
