One morning in the spring last year, my partner, Lisa, said, "I'm thinking about running for City Council. What do you think?"

What did I think?

I was flooded with excitement! Not only is she one of the most qualified candidates I could imagine but with the historic changes to Portland's government we both knew this was a unique moment.

We talked over brunch in late February and said that "win, lose, or withdraw" we'd learn a lot together.

We definitely learned a ton. Sitting here after the election, I can spoil the ending: didn't win a seat. But the past year is something I'll never forget.

We went from a first-time campaign and candidate ("what if we tried this?") in February 2024 to finishing 7th in a crowded field of 30 candidates.

<a href="https://rcvresults.multco.us/Reports/a18a5db1-04a2-4123-8ccb-de12b485f135-City_of_Portland_Councilor_District_4"><img src="/assets/campaign-recap/election-results.png"/></a>

Through matching funds with the City's [Small Donor Program](https://www.portland.gov/smalldonorelections) we raised [$65k from nearly 500 individual donors](https://openelectionsportland.org/?financing=all&startDate=Fri+Aug+11+2023+00:00:00+GMT-0700+(Pacific+Daylight+Time)&offices=+Councilor+District+4) (thank you to so many friends!). We tried so hard along the way to be good to everyone who joined the fight and to run not as a flattened slogan on a mailer but as a real person with conviction and hope. The hope part might have been naive, neither one of us had ever worked seriously on a campaign before, but we didn't know what we didn't know.

It's hard to even remember all the misconceptions we started with. We had a lot of great people join Lisa's kitchen cabinet to coach us away from some of our most ill-informed schemes ("New Blooms" was too vague a slogan for example) but we did stick to our principles (we didn't give a dime to Musk's X or Zuckerberg's platforms - certainly the most controversial decision within the campaign).

We both made major life decisions to make all this happen. I worked as a volunteer on the campaign from the beginning in February to November 5th with a stretch starting in July almost entirely focused on the campaign (I had a few contract gigs and other projects, but I'm proud of the amount of focus I was able to put into the campaign). I knew this might be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and Lisa and I got to do so much of it together - something I'll always be grateful for.

# What did we do?

The list is huge!

- I made my first zine! I took photos and parts from Lisa's kickoff speech in April and blended them into a "thank you" gift for early donors. Was it silly? Yeah. Not an effective marketing scheme at scale, but I learned so much finally RISO printing and binding it ourselves.

- I learned about Ranked Choice Voting tabulation and did some early modeling of potential election scenarios. Thank you to the amazing developers at the [Ranked Choice Voting Resource Center](https://www.rcvresources.org/) for answering my questions and providing helpful guidance early on.

- I learned how to build an [Observable dashboard](https://observablehq.com/) using public data to look at donations.

- Built and grew the [campaign website](https://www.lisaforportland.com/). Not rocket science, but an essential task.
- And for the real challenge: [dozens and dozens of campaign ads and media](https://youtube.com/@lisafreemanforportland?feature=shared) (keep scrolling!).

# Campaign Ads
Getting to dust off my old camera gear to create videos for the campaign was a big part of why I woke up so many days excited to work on the campaign. I was rusty. In some of the early videos you can tell I was getting my production legs back under me ([scripts that were too long and wandering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE9Oewh7dbU), [weak audio mixing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZLKLOeQUp4)).

By September we hit our stride and released, on average, a new video every week up until the election. Was it too much content? Should we have focused on quality over quantity? We made deliberate choices to be ["80% right at the right time instead of 100% right too late."](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CanVmS2QaoM) For me, that meant trying to listen and adapt to what was working. We experimented a lot.

## Keep it simple
One of the best performing ads was this quick ad listing climate endorsements.

</div>

We filmed it in an afternoon near the house and I had it posted the next day. Less than 24 hour turnaround.

## Upbeat?
We tried to bring positive energy to the campaign trail, but...

</div>

...some of the feedback we got is that people were angry. There's a lot broken in the city. Fun vibes came off a little too cheery.

## Public safety
People wanted solutions on public safety. So we created several ads about Lisa's unique experience leading gun violence reduction efforts and volunteering as a self-defense instructor.

<div class="extended-content-container">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th class="two-videos"><iframe width=400 height=220 src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4t9qnjRlfiw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      </th>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

Those ads are probably the closest we came to pushing the narrative away from the [Overton window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) of simplistic questions like, "how many more cops will you hire?"

## Democracy
Throughout the campaign Lisa kept refining her 60 second pitch (with so many candidates running forums often set short time limits) and with only a few weeks left she got [strong responses from voters at forums](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/do7yMmNm2_E) and at doors talking about the threats to democracy. [For symbolic reasons](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/17/892277592/federal-officers-use-unmarked-vehicles-to-grab-protesters-in-portland), we filmed outside the Federal courthouse downtown and turned this ad around quickly to try and make it part of the closing argument.

</div>
I love this ad because it speaks to one of the main animating forces for me - protecting Portland.

## Rank 6!
One of the best parts of the campaign, because of multi-member districts and ranked choice voting, was getting to know other great candidates. Because of some of the ranked choice voting scenarios I looked at early in the campaign we wanted to appeal to a broad swath of voters and encourage people to use their voice by filing out all 6 rankings on their ballot. Towards the end of the campaign it became clear that many voters were unsure who to rank beyond the first couple of bubbles. We joined up with other progressive candidates in our district to make these fun "rank us both" ads.

    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
Ultimately, a lot of progressive votes stayed together as candidates were eliminated and we all helped propel [Mitch Green](https://www.portland.gov/council/districts/4/mitch-green) across the 25% threshold to win a seat. A feat that many thought was impossible considering the conservative lean of the district in previous elections.

## Why vote?
With less than a week left in the campaign I sat down with Lisa for a loooong (too long) interview and pulled together this last ad trying to push the final GOTV. More people than you might think were answering their doors during canvassing and saying how unenthusiastic they were. We tried to encourage people to be engaged with the local election even if they didn't like the top of the ticket.
