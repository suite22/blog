  <p>In Apple’s massive list of new features today at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/">WWDC</a> is an option to “focus.” <a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/craig-federighi/">Craig Federighi</a>’s pitch was, “focus is a new way to match your device to your current mind-set.”</p>

<p><a title="Apple WWDC 2021 Keynote" href="https://youtu.be/0TD96VTf0Xs?t=1134"><img alt="Match phone to mind-set" src="/assets/wwdc-keynote2021-mood.gif" /></a></p>

<p>I’ve been mulling that sentence (and the ideas that support it) for most of the afternoon.</p>

<h2 id="control-flow">Control Flow</h2>
<p>Which way does the control flow? Do you change your device to match your mood or is your device changing your mood?</p>

<p>A study of smartphone users (the title is aptly called “Brain Drain”) found that the mere presence of a phone, even when silenced, is enough to significantly lower our ability to focus on a task.</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="true" data-title="Brain Drain: The Mere Presence of One’s Own Smartphone Reduces Available Cognitive Capacity" data-author="McCombs School of Business" cite="https://news.utexas.edu/2017/06/26/the-mere-presence-of-your-smartphone-reduces-brain-power/">
<div><div>Having a smartphone within sight or within easy reach reduces a person’s ability to focus and perform tasks because part of their brain is actively working to not pick up or use the phone.</div><br /><div>“It’s not that participants were distracted because they were getting notifications on their phones,” said Ward. “The mere presence of their smartphone was enough to reduce their cognitive capacity.”</div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.calnewport.com">Cal Newport</a>’s recent book “<a href="https://bookshop.org/books/digital-minimalism-choosing-a-focused-life-in-a-noisy-world/9780525536512">Digital Minimalism</a>” is a good compliment to his older book “<a href="https://bookshop.org/books/deep-work-rules-for-focused-success-in-a-distracted-world-9781455586677/9781455586677">Deep Work</a>”, which I think taken together point towards a better path. The most obvious option for silencing your devices is to leave them behind. Walk away.</p>

<h2 id="design-space">Design Space</h2>
<p>Apple, or any company, is unlikely to reach a design solution that means less of what they make or profit from. One of the choices on the list of “Focus” options (in the gif above) includes sleep! Is sleep a “mind-set”?</p>

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="true" data-title="Sleep Is Our Competition" data-author="Reed Hastings" cite="https://www.fastcompany.com/40491939/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-sleep-is-our-competition">
<div>"You get a show or a movie you’re really dying to watch, and you end up staying up late at night, so we actually compete with sleep,” he said of his No. 1 competitor. Not that he puts too much stock in his rival: "And we’re winning!"</div>

<p>So far no one has found a way to profit off your sleep. I’m okay with protecting my time and sleep myself.</p>

<p>Is Apple’s aim to help you match the device to your mind-set or your mind-set to their device?</p>
